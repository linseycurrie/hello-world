# hello-world
First GitHub Program
....
This is my first program using GitHub :) I am new to software development. I have been working with the Open University for the last two years learning such concepts as  the workings of a computer, basics of networking, different programming languages such as Scratch, Python and Java. 
I am due to start CodeClan in Aug and I hope this new found knowledge will lead me into a new career in Technology :)
